# Welcome to the Jungle ðŸŒ´ðŸŒ´

Jungle is a Ruby on Rails 4.2-based mini e-commerce application. 

Many of the application's features were already in place when the codebase was inherited. I used the existing code style and approach to fix existing bugs and implement new features after analysing the codebase and becoming familiar with the Rails framework. 

I also used RSpec, Poltergeist, and PhantomJS to implement model validation and feature spec tests.
